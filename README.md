# **Jason BDI Agents for UAV Control in PX4 SITL Search and Rescue Simulation**
Embedded-MAS Agents at /AgentsEMAS , more details at https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/tree/master/examples/jacamo/ros

## **Introduction**



This project demonstrates the use of **Jason BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agents** to control **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** in a **PX4 SITL (Software In The Loop)** search and rescue simulation. The goal is to showcase the application of **BDI cognitive architectures** in autonomous UAV systems, focusing on their ability to plan and execute search and rescue missions in simulated environments.

In this setup, the UAVs are controlled by **BDI agents**, which operate within the **ROS Noetic** environment. The simulation leverages **PX4-Autopilot** for realistic flight dynamics and **Gazebo** for simulation of the UAV's environment. The **rosbridge-suite** is used to facilitate communication between ROS and external applications.

echo "export PATH=\$JAVA_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **6. Install Jason BDI**

Clone the **Jason BDI** repository and build it:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.chon.group/ chonos main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chonos.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jason-cli
```

### **7. Set Up Catkin Workspace**

Create a **catkin workspace** for ROS and clone the project repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/natereza/moving_plataform_gazebo.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
catkin_make
```
---

## **Environment Variables**

The following environment variables are set in your `~/.bashrc` for the project to work:

```bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup_gazebo.bash ~/PX4-Autopilot ~/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=\$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=\$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=\$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-11/plugins" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=\$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/catkin_ws" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:~/catkin_ws/src/moving_plataform_gazebo/models" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

These variables are sourced automatically when you start a new shell.

## **Installation Setup (With Docker)**

You can run this setup using Docker. For [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) it is recommended to have [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natereza/moving_plataform_gazebo.git
   cd moving_plataform_gazebo
   ```

3. **Build the Docker image**:
4. ```bash
   docker build -t moving-test .
   ```

This command builds the Docker image for this project. The first build may take a long time (20–60 minutes), because it installs ROS Noetic, PX4 SITL, Gazebo, and compiles all dependencies.

3. **Verify the image was built**:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

You should see an image named moving-test.


### **For Windows Users (with VCXsrv)**

1. **Install VCXsrv** from [here](https://github.com/marchaesen/vcxsrv) and start it with XLaunch using default settings.
   
2. **Set the DISPLAY environment**:
Set the `DISPLAY` to point to the host machine’s X11 server:
     ```bash
     set DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0
     ```

3. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --env DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 --net host moving-test
   ```

   You could add another volume if you're working on agents source code on your host machine, just add the following in the docker run command mentioned above:
   ```bash
   --volume /path/on/host:/path/in/container
   ```
---

### **For Linux Users**

1. **Allow Docker to access the X11 server**:
   ```bash
   xhost +local:docker
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 --net host natereza/moving_plataform_gazebo
   ```
   You could add another volume if you're working on agents source code on your host machine, just add the following in the docker run command mentioned above:
   ```bash
   --volume /path/on/host:/path/in/container
   ```

---
### **Tips for Docker**
You can open another terminal in the docker image by joining the same container, first check which containers are running:

**Abrir outro terminal dentro do container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it moving_container bash
   ```

1. **Check running containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
Then you can join your container on a new terminal by entering, make sure to replace container_name to your own:

2. **Open a new terminal in the container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -ti container_name bash
   ```
   

---


## **How to Use the Setup**
Start by running the Gazebo Simulation and spawning the PX4 UAVs
```bash
roslaunch moving_plataform_gazebo multi_uav_mavros_sitl.launch
```
This should open a ROS-Gazebo simulation of 3 UAVs in a rescue scenario. From there you can control these UAVs with MAVROS topics and services such as
```bash
rosservice call /uav0/mavros/cmd/arming 1
```
This arms the motors of uav0, and you should see in the same terminal the response
```bash
success: True
result: 0
```
*(More Instructions to be filled in later)*
